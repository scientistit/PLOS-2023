Main code of this folder: FeatureSelectionAndClassRecognitionComputations
To Perform Feature Selection and Class Recognition we need to select a set of features.
We recommend testing this code of feature tables located in FeatureTables folder.
You can choose weather to select features on your own or to apply feature selection method.
Fs methods require fspackage so to verify how these methods work you need to attach weka.
If you have problems attaching weka we recommend hardcoding the set of features (you can find information about features selected by these methods in Table 3 of the article).
In folders ExampleResultsForTable3/4/5 we present example outputs of the code with parameters set to ones defined in tables 3, 4 and 5. The numbers 1-3 mean that we invoked the code three times.
In folder ExampleResultsForTable6InTheArticle the exemplary results are calculated based on 'OtherCoder'.
