To create rotated image turn on the CreateRotatedImages code.
The images that are considered in Table 1 are located in RotatedShapes folder.
ExemplaryRotBac collects values of distances and angles calculated on bacteria-shaped object.
To calculate correlations presented in table 1 and 2 invoke the code located in: FeaturesBasedOnShapeChooseCertainStartingPointPresCorrShapes.
The correlation values are printed in console.
The code (FeaturesBasedOnShapeChooseCertainStartingPointPresCorrShapes) is a part of code for tables 3-5 in results of article. This code was extracted to prove the vitality of the idea of correlations between vectors of distances and angles in objects.
We didn't remove from it the unused functionalities (they were used for tables 3-5 - the main code) like for example selecting x bacteria instances that are closest to median.
